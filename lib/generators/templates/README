Gitlab has copied some things into your app:

* A #{db_type} database config file, config/database.yml
* A database migration file to build the Gitlab schema
* Scripts for command-line tasks
* Default configuration files for Gitlab and Unicorn in config/
* Example configuration files for Resque and AWS in config/
* Initializers in config/initializers that should be modified as required

Before you do anything else, you should modify config/database.yml to
suit your needs, then run `bundle exec rake db:migrate` to build the
gitlab database schema.
